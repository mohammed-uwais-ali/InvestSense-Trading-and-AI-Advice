# Project Idea for SEO Project #2

## Overview
The project concept revolves around creating an application designed to enable automatic trading, provide AI-backed advice, and rebalance users' portfolios. The system will function based on a user-inputted plan or by mimicking the trades of renowned public traders such as Nancy Pelosi, Micheal Burry, and others. 

Our application's fundamental operation involves linking users' brokerage accounts (initially, with TD Ameritrade and Robinhood), fetching the user's account information, storing it into an SQL database, and executing trades based on the selected portfolio. AI advice and suggestions will be generated using OpenAI's GPT API, and information from sec-api.io and senator_trading will allow for tracking and executing trades that mirror successful public traders.

## Project Objectives:
1. Utilize our full-stack development skills to create an innovative and user-friendly application.
2. Build a tool that provides real value to users and improves their trading experience.
3. Collect and integrate feedback regularly to ensure continuous improvement and development of the project.

## Project Requirements:
- The project will be carried out by a team of three members, each with equal contributions.
- The application will be modular, consisting of at least three distinct modules.
- The app will process data from various sources, including APIs, images, videos, etc.
- Implement a comprehensive testing plan, ensuring thorough tests to maintain the highest quality and functionality.

## Roles and Responsibilities:
1. **Backend Developer**: Responsible for setting up the SQL database, establishing a secure connection with brokerages, and executing trades.
2. **Frontend Developer**: In charge of designing and implementing a user-friendly interface, integrating the AI advice generator, and creating custom portfolio creation tools.
3. **Data Specialist**: Tasked with processing data from sec-api.io, senator_trading, and other sources, and ensuring its seamless integration into the system.
